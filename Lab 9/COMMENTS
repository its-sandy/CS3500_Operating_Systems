The assignment helped me understand the practical issues associated when implementing the theory concepts we had studied.

The assignment refers to Virtual Memory as some sort of common address space shared by all processes. However, we had studied in class that each process has its own virtual/logical address space. Later, the TAs had clarified that the assignment had meant to mimic the swap space. This could have been explained in the assignment pdf.
