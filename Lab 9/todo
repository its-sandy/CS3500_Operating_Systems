should each process be loaded as pages or as complete processes.
can you assign some pages of a process to MM and some to VM.
while loading a bunch of processes, if there is no space for one of them but there is enough space for processes further up in the list, what should be done?

how should swap be done from VM to MM? ... should u require a temporary storage space for the same?	

common VM for all processes right? So, 2 processes can access the same address (provided it falls into their Logical address space limits) ... should there be a common dictionary for all processes?

what should be there in page table?

what if VM has no space during swapout

can any process size be larger than MM or VM?

can u run a process in VM?

what about print <memloc> <length>
