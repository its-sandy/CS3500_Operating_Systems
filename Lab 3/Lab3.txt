CS3500 - Operating Systems
July-Nov 2018
Lab Exercise 3
Aug. 20, 2018
Online submission: Aug. 20, 2018, 9pm on Moodle

Demo to TAs due on or before Aug. 23, 2018, 5.30pm using code
downloaded from Moodle

Demo. can be shown on your laptop or on one of Systems Lab/Hardware
Lab machines.

MOSS/other code similarity checking software will be used.
============================

Implement a mini-shell program in C using UNIX system calls, including
fork and execvp (or similar). 

In the demo, the TAs can ask you to rewrite the code using a different
version of exec (e.g. execlp, etc.)  command other than what is used
in your program. You can refer the Man pages during the demo.

****

The program will start by displaying a command prompt, as follows:

Command> 

(1) Whenever the user enters a command (with optional arguments), the
program will spawn a new process that will execute the specified
command. For example:

Command> ls -l

will produce the output of ls -l.

Command> date

will produce the output of date command.

(2) Background process: the user can specify that a command has to be
  run in the background using '&' symbol.

INPUT:

Command> ls -l &

OUTPUT:

The mini-shell will return to the Command prompt and accept the next
command. The child process that is running the 'ls -l' will output to
the screen when it completes. 

(3) Exiting: When the user types "exit" or "quit", the shell program exits.
