are all pizzas in a maker batch added continuously while holding the shelf
should the pizza maker know that all shelves are full? or should he just keep trying at random?
what if after the wait, the randomly chosen shelf turns out to be full
should there be a mapping between id given to inserted and eaten pizzas? If not so, why should v even maintain queues?
how many maker and user threads should be there?
